  abstract={Recent advances in cloud technology have turned the idea of cloud gaming into a reality. Cloud gaming, in its simplest form, renders an interactive gaming application remotely in the cloud and streams the scenes as a video sequence back to the player over the Internet. This is an advantage for less powerful computational devices that are otherwise incapable of running high-quality games. Such industrial pioneers as Onlive and Gaikai have seen success in the market with large user bases. In this article, we conduct a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art cloud gaming platforms, and highlight the uniqueness of their framework design. We also measure their real world performance with different types of games, for both interaction latency and streaming quality, revealing critical challenges toward the widespread deployment of cloud gaming.},
